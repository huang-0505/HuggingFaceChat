â€¢ **Higher protein, easily digestible food** - Look for senior cat formulas with 35-45% protein
â€¢ **Smaller, more frequent meals** - 3-4 small meals daily instead of 2 large ones
â€¢ **Wet food is crucial** - Senior cats are prone to kidney issues and need extra hydration
â€¢ **Joint support** - Foods with glucosamine/chondroitin or omega-3 fatty acids
â€¢ **Regular weight monitoring** - Senior cats can lose muscle mass

For an 18-year-old cat, I'd specifically recommend prescription senior diets like Hill's k/d or Royal Canin Senior. Have you noticed any changes in appetite, weight, or litter box habits? Senior cats should have bloodwork every 6 months to monitor kidney and thyroid function.`

â€¢ **Senior dog formula** with appropriate protein levels for their kidney function
â€¢ **Joint support ingredients** - Glucosamine, chondroitin, omega-3s
â€¢ **Easier to digest** - May need smaller kibble size or wet food
â€¢ **Weight management** - Senior dogs are less active and prone to weight gain
â€¢ **Regular vet checkups** every 6 months

What's your dog's current weight and activity level? Large breeds are considered senior at 6-7 years, while small breeds at 10-12 years.`

**Immediate actions:**
1. **Call emergency vet NOW** or pet poison control: (888) 426-4435
2. **Induce vomiting ONLY if instructed** by vet (within 2 hours of ingestion)
3. **Bring chocolate packaging** to show vet the type and amount

**Toxicity depends on:**
- Type: Baking chocolate > Dark chocolate > Milk chocolate > White chocolate
- Amount consumed vs dog's weight
- Time since ingestion

**Symptoms to watch for:** Vomiting, diarrhea, excessive thirst, restlessness, rapid heart rate, seizures

**How much chocolate and what type did your dog eat? What's your dog's weight?** Time is critical!`

â€¢ **Adults (1-7 years):** 2-3 meals of adult cat food  
â€¢ **Seniors (7+ years):** 2-3 smaller meals of senior formula

**Food quality indicators:**
â€¢ First ingredient should be named meat (chicken, salmon, etc.)
â€¢ Avoid foods with excessive corn, wheat, or by-products
â€¢ Look for AAFCO certification

**Wet vs Dry:** Cats need moisture - aim for 70% wet food, 30% dry

â€¢ **Young adults (6 months-2 years):** 2 meals daily
â€¢ **Adults (2-7 years):** 2 meals daily
â€¢ **Seniors (7+ years):** 2 smaller meals daily

**Portion sizes depend on:**
- Current weight and target weight
- Activity level (working dogs need more calories)
- Breed size (large breeds have different needs)

**Quality indicators:**
â€¢ Named meat as first ingredient
â€¢ No excessive fillers or by-products
â€¢ Appropriate for life stage

What's your dog's breed, age, current weight, and activity level? I can then calculate exact portions and recommend specific foods.`
